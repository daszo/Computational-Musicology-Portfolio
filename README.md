Drum and Bass and dubstep are both music genres that emerged form the London underground music scene. Dubstep can be seen as a newer version of Drum and Bass although they both have slightly different inspirations. Drum and Bass and dubstep differ mostly in beat tempo, but also carry many similarities between them. Some of the most similar subgenres between these two syles are Neuro and Brostep/Burvstep. These styles are typically more aggressive and tend to lend sounds form each other. Neuro is more of a niche genre where as Brostep is much bigger and contains more subgenres that subdivide it. My question is, what are the similarities between two playlist the given playlist and what can this tell us about the two different styles.

The first playlist included here is my own playlist that I have cultivated by using this as my main playlist for over 7 years. Other music I listen to would normally not end up in this playlist, but it may not always have been used in a verry accurate manner.

The second playlist that I included is of my friend that mostly listens to drum and bass. His favorite genre is Neuro which what this playlist contains. This playlist is more recent and more precisely cultivated to be the specific subgenre Neuro.
